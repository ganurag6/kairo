# Kairo Product Analysis & Enhancement Strategy

## Current App Understanding

**Kairo** is an Electron-based AI assistant application that acts as a global text processing tool.

### Core Functionality
- **Text Capture**: Uses global shortcut `Cmd+K`/`Ctrl+K` to capture selected text from anywhere on screen
- **AI Processing**: Integrates with OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model for text analysis and improvement
- **Quick Actions**: Provides preset actions like grammar fixing, summarization, translation, etc.
- **Chat Interface**: Allows follow-up conversations about captured text

### Architecture
- **Multi-window setup**: 
  - Main overlay window (`index.html`) - primary chat interface
  - Action picker (`action-picker.html`) - quick action buttons
  - Response window (`response-window.html`) - displays AI responses
- **System integration**: System tray, global shortcuts, clipboard management
- **Cross-platform**: Supports macOS, Windows, and Linux

### Key Features
- Global text selection and processing
- Smart AI suggestions based on text type
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Always-on-top overlay windows
- Privacy-focused (local operation, direct OpenAI API calls)

### Recent Changes (from git status)
- Modified `main.js` and `styles.css`
- New files: action picker components, response window components, preload scripts

## User Adoption Potential: **Medium-High**

### Strengths that drive adoption:
- **Global text capture** is genuinely useful - the Cmd+K pattern is intuitive
- **Privacy-first approach** appeals to security-conscious users
- **Cross-platform** removes barriers
- **Quick actions** solve real pain points (grammar, conciseness, etc.)

### Adoption barriers:
- Requires users to provide their own OpenAI API key (friction)
- Competes with established tools (Grammarly, Notion AI)
- Limited discoverability without marketing

## Differentiation Strategies

### 1. **Context Awareness**
```javascript
// Add smart context detection
- Detect email vs. document vs. code vs. social media
- Adapt suggestions based on context
- Remember user patterns and preferences
```

### 2. **Workflow Integration**
- **Template system**: Save frequently used prompts
- **Multi-step workflows**: "Fix grammar → Make professional → Copy to email"
- **Integration hooks**: Slack, Discord, email clients

### 3. **Advanced Text Intelligence**
- **Tone analysis**: Detect and adjust formality levels
- **Audience targeting**: "Make this suitable for executives/customers/developers"
- **Language style matching**: Learn user's writing style

### 4. **Specialized Use Cases**
- **Developer mode**: Code explanation, documentation generation
- **Academic mode**: Citation formatting, research summaries
- **Content creator mode**: SEO optimization, social media variants

### 5. **Enhanced UX**
- **Preview mode**: Show before/after side-by-side
- **Undo/redo**: Version history for text changes
- **Batch processing**: Handle multiple selections
- **Smart clipboard**: Remember and manage multiple processed texts

### 6. **Unique Features**
- **Offline mode**: Local LLM integration for basic tasks
- **Team sharing**: Share custom prompts and workflows
- **Analytics**: Show writing improvement over time
- **Voice input**: Speak instructions instead of typing

## Key Opportunity

**Biggest opportunity**: Become the "Spotlight for text" - make it so fast and convenient that users reach for it instinctively for any text task.

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Impact, Low Effort**:
   - Template system for custom prompts
   - Context detection (email/code/document)
   - Preview mode

2. **High Impact, Medium Effort**:
   - Workflow chaining
   - Smart clipboard management
   - Tone analysis

3. **High Impact, High Effort**:
   - Local LLM integration
   - Advanced analytics
   - Team features

## Competitive Positioning

- **vs. Grammarly**: More versatile (not just grammar), works everywhere
- **vs. Notion AI**: Faster access, works outside of Notion
- **vs. ChatGPT**: Integrated into workflow, context-aware
- **vs. Raycast**: Text-focused, more specialized

## Next Steps

1. Implement context detection system
2. Build template/prompt management
3. Add workflow chaining capabilities
4. Enhance UX with preview mode
5. Explore local LLM integration for offline use
